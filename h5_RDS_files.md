1) 10X CellRanger output h5 matrix files containing single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from each stage of differentiation profiled in our paper (D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D7, and D10)
2) An RDS file in which data from each stage has been combined into a single Seurat object (used to generate Fig. 5G and our interactive online browser, both linked below)
